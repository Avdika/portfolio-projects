   - Enable sparse checkout:

     ```sh
     git config core.sparseCheckout true
     ```

3. **Specify the Folder to Checkout**:

   - Create a `.git/info/sparse-checkout` file and add the paths of the folders you want to checkout.
     For example, to checkout only the `rock-paper-scissors-extended/plain-js` folder:

     ```sh
     echo "rock-paper-scissors-extended/plain-js/" >> .git/info/sparse-checkout
     ```
